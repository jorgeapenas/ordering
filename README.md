# Introduction

This software performs the numerical routines and produces the figures for the paper **Ordering structured populations in multiplayer cooperation games**, by *Jorge Pe√±a*, *Bin Wu*, and *Arne Traulsen*. 

# Included files

* *exact_volumes.sws*: Sage worksheet to calculate exactly volumes of polytopes. It uses the function volume of the class Polyhedron.
* *ordering_population_structures.ipynb*: an interactive IPython notebook that runs all the code necessary to replicate Fig. 2, 3, and 4. It includes a routine to estimate volumes using a Monte Carlo method.
* *vol1_paper.out* and *vol2_paper.out*: data for Fig. 4.
* *README.md*: This file.

# Dependencies

* *ordering_population_structures.ipynb* was created with *IPython* version 4.0.
* *exact_volumes.sws* was created with Sage version 6.5.
